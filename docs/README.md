# bgpipe: BGP reverse proxy and firewall

bgpipe is an open source tool for processing BGP messages, for example as a proxy between two BGP peers, that can inspect and modify BGP sessions on the fly.
It is based on a [Golang BGPFix library](https://bgpfix.org/), available for many platforms, and distributed under the MIT license.
